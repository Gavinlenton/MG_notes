Git notes

Keep a copy of any code/text (e.g., thesis)

git config - - global user.name “Name"
git config - - global user.email

CREATE NEW REPOSITORY
git init to initialise git
ls -a to check if git folder is there

git status - what is going on in the project - check if there are files not saved/committed

When changes are made:

ADD FILE
git add “filename” to add file to repository

COMMIT FILE
git commit -m “comment about file commit"

OR

- To auto add and commit file change

git commit -am “comment about file"

END

git log to see changes made

TO COMPARE DIFFERENCES
git add filename
git diff - -staged - compares file in repository against one in folder - highlights the changes between the two

Head is the current commit - there’s a commit id for every commit made (use at least 8 characters)
Can go back with Head~1
Or Head~2
e.g., git diff HEAD~1 mars.txt

MISTAKES MADE - revert to previous
git checkout HEAD mars.txt

If you lose your head (e.g., git checkout “some previous version", go to > git checkout master

GIT IGNORE
.gitignore in same folder as .git to ignore certain files or folder types from repository

GIT REMOTE REPOSITORIES
set up a remote
git remote add origin url copied (e.g., https://github.com/Gavinlenton/planets-github-gl.git)
origin = local repository that I am currently working on

git remote -v to list remote repositories set up
fetch = pulling down from repository
push = pushing up to repository

push data from local to remote
git push origin master
Pull data from remote to master
git pull origin master
Clone repository
git clone “html to repository"
